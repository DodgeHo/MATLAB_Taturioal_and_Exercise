# MATLAB_Tutorials_and_Exercise

Written by: Dodge(Lang HE) asdsay@gmail.com Updated date: 2023-06-04
Just some Tutorials and some exercises while I am teaching and studying MATLAB.
All tutorials are originally written by me, but some exercises are not. I will mark the resource reference as many as I can.

                (VaR was calculated by Monte Carlo simulation method)







Tutorials are saved in folder **matlab_courses**.
Since I mainly work on image and signal processing, I have two folders for them.
And also there are others in **others**.

I will give more details in future, if I upload more files.
